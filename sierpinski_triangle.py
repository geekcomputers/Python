Simple example of Fractal generation using recursive function.

What is Sierpinski Triangle?
>>The Sierpinski triangle (also with the original orthography Sierpinski), also called the Sierpinski gasket or the Sierpinski Sieve,
is a fractal and attractive fixed set with the overall shape of an equilateral triangle, subdivided recursively into smaller
equilateral triangles. Originally constructed as a curve, this is one of the basic examples of self-similar sets, i.e.,
it is a mathematically generated pattern that can be reproducible at any magnification or reduction. It is named after
the Polish mathematician Wac≈Çaw Sierpinski, but appeared as a decorative pattern many centuries prior to the work of Sierpinski.
