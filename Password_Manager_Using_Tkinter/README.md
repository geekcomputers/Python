# My Personal Password Manager

Hello there! Welcome to my Password Manager project. I created this application to provide a simple and secure way **to manage all my website login credentials in one place**. It's a desktop application **built with Python**, and I've focused on making it both functional and easy on the eyes.

## What It Can Do

- **Generate Strong Passwords**: One click = secure, random passwords (auto-copied to clipboard!).

- **Save Credentials**: Store site name, email/username, and password safely.

- **Quick Search**: Instantly find saved logins by website name.

- **View All Passwords**: Unlock all saved entries with your master password ‚Äî neatly organized in a table.

- **One-Click Copy**: Copy email or password directly from the list for quick logins.

---

## How I Built It

- **Python**: Powers the core logic behind the app.

- **Tkinter**: Handles the clean and simple user interface.

- **ttkbootstrap**: Adds a modern, professional theme to the UI.

- **JSON**: Stores all password data securely in a local data.json file.
