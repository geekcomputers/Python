# Author				: Craig Richards
# Created				: 27th February 2012
# Last Modified		: 20th July 2012
# Version				: 1.3
# Modifications		: 1.1 - 28-02-2012 - CR - Changed inside github and development functions, so instead of if os.name = "posix" do this else do this etc
# 							: I used os.path.join, so it condensed 4 lines down to 1
# 							: 1.2 - 10-05-2012 - CR - Added a line to include PHP scripts.
# 							: 1.3 - 20-07-2012 - CR - Added the line to include Batch scripts
# Description			: This scans my scripts directory and gives a count of the different types of scripts
