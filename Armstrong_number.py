"""
In number theory, a narcissistic number (also known as a pluperfect digital invariant (PPDI), an Armstrong number (after Michael F. Armstrong) or a plus perfect number),
in a given number base b, is a number that is the total of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

this scripts only works for number in base 10
