# FizzBuzz
# A program that prints the numbers from 1 to num (User given number)!
# For multiples of ‘3’ print “Fizz” instead of the number.
# For the multiples of ‘5’ print “Buzz”.
# If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 then print "FizzBuzz".
# If none of the given conditions are true then just print the number!
