# add a while loop to keep asking for the user input.
# also make sure to add a about menu to input a while loop in tkinter app.

# It can use a beautiful GUI also.
# Even validation is left.
# What if string is provided in number? Then?
# What if chars are provided. Then?
# What if a negative number is provided? Then?
# What if a number is provided in alphabets characters? Then?
# Can it a single method have more object in it?

# Also need to perform testing on it.
# EXTREME FORM OF TESTING NEED TO BE PERFORMED ON IT.
# Documentation is also needed.
# Comments are also needed.
# TYPE hints are also needed.

# README.md file is also needed.
## Which will explain the whole project.
### Like how to use the application.
### List down the features in explicit detail.
### How to use different methods and classes.
### It will also a image of the project in working state.
### It will also have a video to the project in working state.

# It should also have .exe and linux executable file.
# It should also be installable into Windows(x86) system and if possible into Linux system also.
