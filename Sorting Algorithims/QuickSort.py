# Python program for implementation of Quicksort Sort

# the pivot element at its correct position in sorted
# array, and places all smaller (smaller than pivot)
# to left of pivot and all greater elements to right
# of pivot

        # equal to pivot

# arr[] --> Array to be sorted,
# low  --> Starting index,
# high  --> Ending index
