"""
program first asks the user how many values they want to enter. Then, using a loop, it lets the user enter that many values one by one.
Each entered value is saved into a list called l1. Once all the values are entered, the program prints the complete list, showing 
everything the user typed. It's a beginner-friendly way to learn how to collect multiple inputs and store them for later use.
