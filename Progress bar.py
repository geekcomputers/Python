    #{color + bar + Style.RESET_ALL} --> Sums the Fore color character to create a pretty colored bar on the screen
    #percent:.2f --> ":.xf" allows to round to x value of decimal points (2 in this case). It is important, for this script, that the two print statement use the same x value to avoid misprinting
    #{color}{percent:.2f}{Style.RESET_ALL} --> Same as previous but since "percent" is of type float it can't be directly added to a string. 
    #                                          To fix this you can either use this sintax or convert it to str by doing {color + str(percent:.2f) + Style.RESET_ALL}
