# Description   : This script will check to see if all of the environment variables I require are set

import os

confdir = os.getenv(
    "my_config"
)  # Set the variable confdir from the OS environment variable
conffile = "env_check.conf"  # Set the variable conffile
conffilename = os.path.join(
    confdir, conffile
)  # Set the variable conffilename by joining confdir and conffile together

for env_check in open(conffilename):  # Open the config file and read all the settings
    env_check = (
        env_check.strip()
    )  # Set the variable as itself, but strip the extra text out
    print(f"[{env_check}]")  # Format the Output to be in Square Brackets
    newenv = os.getenv(
        env_check
    )  # Set the variable newenv to get the settings from the OS what is currently set for the settings out the configfile

    if newenv is None:  # If it doesn't exist
        print(env_check, "is not set")  # Print it is not set
    else:  # Else if it does exist
        print(
            f"Current Setting for {env_check}={newenv}\n"
        )  # Print out the details
