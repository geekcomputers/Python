I do not consider myself as a programmer. I create these little programs as experiments to play with Python, or to solve problems for myself. I would gladly accept pointers from others to improve, simplify, or make the code more efficient. If you would like to make any comments then please feel free to email me: craig@geekcomputers.co.uk.

_**Note**: The content in this repository belongs to the respective authors and creators. I'm just providing a formatted README.md for better presentation._

## How to Run?
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/geekcomputers/Python.git
   cd Python
2. Choose a script to run  
Each script in this repository is standalone and can be executed directly.

## Dependencies  
Most scripts in this repository rely only on the Python standard library, so they can usually run without installing extra packages.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important**  
> 
> Some scripts may require additional Python libraries.  
> The repository provides a dependency file (e.g., `requirements.txt`) as a reference, but it may not list all required packages.  
> Check each script's header or comments for any extra dependencies that may need manual installation.  
> 
> To install the listed dependencies, run:  
> 
> ```bash  
> pip install -r requirements.txt  
> ```  
> 
> For any missing packages, install them manually:  
> 
> ```bash  
> pip install <package-name>  
> ```

## python version support  

> **Note**
>
> Python version support:  
> Most scripts currently run on Python 3.6 and above.  
> In future releases, the minimum supported Python version will gradually be updated to 3.9 or later.
