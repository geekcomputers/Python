    It works by building a `WordMap` that stores words to word-follower-count
    ----------------------------
    e.g. To train the following statement:

    It is not enough to just know how tools work and what they worth,
    we have got to learn how to use them and to use them well.
    And with all these new weapons in your arsenal, we would better
    get those profits fired up

    we create the following:
    {   It: {is:1}
        is: {not:1}
        not: {enough:1}
        enough: {to:1}
        to: {just:1, learn:1, use:2}
        just: {know:1}
        .
        .
        profits: {fired:1}
        fired: {up:1}
    }
    so the word completion for "to" will be "use".
    For optimization, we use another store `WordPrediction` to save the
    predictions for each word
