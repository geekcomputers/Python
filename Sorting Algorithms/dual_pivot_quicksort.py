def dual_pivot_quicksort(arr, low, high):
    """
    Performs Dual-Pivot QuickSort on the input array.

    Dual-Pivot QuickSort is an optimized version of QuickSort that uses
    two pivot elements to partition the array into three segments in each
    recursive call. This improves performance by reducing the number of
    recursive calls, making it faster on average than the single-pivot
    QuickSort.

    Parameters:
    arr (list): The list to be sorted.
    low (int): The starting index of the segment to sort.
    high (int): The ending index of the segment to sort.

    Returns:
    None: Sorts the array in place.

    Partitions the array segment defined by low and high using two pivots.

    This function arranges elements into three sections:
    - Elements less than pivot1

    Parameters:
    arr (list): The list to partition.
    low (int): The starting index of the segment to partition.
    high (int): The ending index of the segment to partition.

    Returns:
