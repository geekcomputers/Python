"""@Author: Anurag Kumar(mailto:anuragkumarak95@gmail.com)
This module is used for generating a TF-IDF file or values from a list of files that contains docs.

What is TF-IDF : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf

python:
  - 3.5

pre-requisites:
  - colorama==0.3.9

sample file format of input:

    ##START(NOT INCLUDED)
    sport smile today because signs Gemini
    little sister dealt severe allergy figure
    about looks gender color attitude nationality respect
    added video playlist Sonic Fightstick Edition
    weeks birthday scott wants camping keeper
    photo taking photo trying auction scale photo
    happy creatively capture story stage magical
    yoongi looks seokjin looking yoongi looking seokjin
    taking glasses because buffering cannot handle
    tried Michelle Obama proceeded defend whole pointless
    robbed shades backstage reading guess karma stealing
    remains sailors destroyer McCain collision found
    timeline beginnings infographics Catch upcoming debut
    ##END(NOT INCLUDED)

here, every line represents a document.

have fun, cheers.
