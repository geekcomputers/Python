# My Interactive Snake Game

Hey there! I’m [Prashant Gohel](https://github.com/prashantgohel321)

I took the classic Snake game and gave it a modern, interactive twist — with a sleek UI, smooth gameplay, and fun new controls. This project was all about making a nostalgic game feel fresh again!

## What I Added

**Fresh UI:** Clean, responsive, and almost full-screen — with a neat header for score and controls.

**Interactive Controls**: Play, Pause, Resume, Restart — all on-screen (plus spacebar support!).

**High Score System**: Tracks and saves your best score in highscore.txt — challenge yourself!

**Smooth Game Flow**: Smart state system for seamless transitions between screens.
